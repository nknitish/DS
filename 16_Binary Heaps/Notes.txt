//Binary Heaps is similar to Binary Search Tree with some extra rules!

MaxBinaryHeap : => In MaxBinaryHeap Parent Node are always larger then child nodes.
MinBinaryHeap : => In MinBinaryHeap Parent Node are always smaller then child nodes.

For any index of an array n;
The left child is stored at 2n+1
The right child is stored at 2n+2



To Access any Parent index from child
Parent Index= (childIndex-1) /2 (Floored)
